# ShredTube #
ShredTube is a site that has snowboarding videos to watch.
Users can like, dislike, favorite, and share each video.
Under each video there is a Spotify implementation to find
the music used in the video. There is also a Google Maps
implementaion that will show a location the video was filmed.
