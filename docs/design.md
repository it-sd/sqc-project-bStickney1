## Aesthetic and Minimalist Design ##
I would like for the site to have a good design that has flow to it. Currently everything is just centered in the page (because it's still a work in progress) and the user needs to scroll to see everything. In the future I would like to remove or minimalize the need for scrolling.

## User Control and Freedom ##
By the end of the project I would like to add the ability for users to remove/hide things that they do not want to see on the page. For example, if the user doesn't want to see the Spoify or Google Maps portion of the page, they can click a button to hide them. I think this would be a convenient feature.
